<p>Industry related data has opened up many job opportunities because of the need for people to make this. According to the “Occupational Outlook Handbook” the job outlook rate is 24%, which is faster than average, but people are still needed for this job. The amount of job openings for this kind of job was 1,256,200 back in 2016, but probably increased to a bigger number by now. Industry related data also affects the ads people see while surfing the internet. The reason being is that big data(industry related data) shows a company what is selling and what is not, which is affecting what kind of ads they want to put out.
